## Fractional CTO who builds engineering teams that don't need him

Scaled [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com) from 3 to 80+ employees (#8 LinkedIn Top Startups UK 2022). Now I help Series A founders build the teams and systems that get them to Series B.

Former CTO/CPO with 10+ years leading distributed engineering teams. Still write code when it matters. TypeScript, React, Node—the usual suspects.

🔭 Currently: Fractional CTO work + building [REALFAST](https://realfast.food) on the side
